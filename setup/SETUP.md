Please read the comments in `setup.sh` and make sure everything is compatible with you system before installation. Specifically, make sure directories and roots are set correctly and aligned with your system. Some commands may need modification, based on your system being `bash` or `csh`.

 Simply run the `setup.sh` from your terminal, and it will automatically install all required prerequisites:
 
```console
user@os:~$ cd setup
user@Ubuntu:~$ chmod +x setup.sh
user@Ubuntu:~$ ./setup.sh
```
